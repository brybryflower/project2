Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Bryan Flower
Submitted: 8/31/22
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This project wasn't too bad. I learned a lot from it, and 
fumbled through it a lot more. It turned out about as well as I expected it to with the
little bit of knowledge I had working with HTML. The hardest part for me was figuring out
the extra decorative items in the code.

            <h2>An Attempt was Made</h2>
            <center>Making a haiku<br>
            Is something I'm not good at<br>
            Spaghetti code time.<br><br>
			</center>
			It is fair to say my inspiration for this haiku never came, and therefore my haiku was made.

			<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
			<p>The reason I'm taking these courses is due to my interest in computer technology. I've always
				been tech savvy, and I think it is so cool to see all the behind-the-scenes work that goes
				into these things. It's very easy to look over all of the minute details that someone spent hours
				pouring over just to make a program.
			</p>
			<p>I thoroughly enjoy water activities such as swimming or boating. Growing up I was part of a swim
				team for 12 years and a water polo team for 6. If I could go and chill on a boat in the sun I'd
				be quite content. A little funny considering my fear of open water, but it is what it is.
			</p>
			<p>I use many varieties of music to motivate me for different things. There isn't a type of music that
				I will not listen to. Music is supposed to make you feel something, and I use that emotion and channel
				it into my work. Even when not actively listening to music, you'll probably find me humming.
